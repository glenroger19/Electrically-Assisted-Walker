Hello everyone, here are the steps of my project. 

Step 1 : Choose an AgilSense HB100 Doppler Sensor.
Step 2 : Amplify the signal out of the sensor which is a voltage between 0 and 4 mV.
Step 3 : Measure the voltage after amplifier which is between 0 to 4 V.
Step 4 : Use a DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) and use the code to measure the speed.
Step 5 : Make a simulation of the motor with different resisting torque.
Step 6 : Make a simulation of the motor speed control and choose a corrector.
Step 7 : Vary the gain of a proportional corrector and the gain of an integral corrector to have an accurate, fast and stable system.

Thank you and see you again.  :)
